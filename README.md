## Section 3 - Javascript Basics: Variables and Flow Control

### What did I learn? 

Everything here is pretty straightforward.

- How to assign variables with the let keyword.

	4. ">"
	5. "<="
	6. ">="
- If, Else, Else-if statements
- And, Or operators

## Section 4 - Javascript Functions

### What did I learn? 

Everything here is pretty straightforward.

- Defining functions
- Undefined and Null, Null meant to avoid ambiguities with undefined ("explicit clearing").
- Multiple arguments.
- Default Arguments. 
- Template Strings.
	- No difference between double and single quotes in JS.
	- Use the dollar sign and curly braces to inject JS into a template string ` ... `
- Made a simple grade calculator.

## Section 5 - Javascript Objects

- The This keyword
- The const
- The Var

## Section 6 - Javascript Arrays

### What did I learn? 

- How to define arrays
- Methods: push, pop, shift and unshift, splice
- forEach and callback functions
- For loops 
- IndexOf 
- findIndex()or find() for arrays of objects
- filter() to return a new array of objects which match some condition
- The sort() method
- Used new knowledge to add methods to the Expense Tracker, Notes and ToDo list apps

## Section 7 - Javascript in the Browser

### What did I learn? 

- Setting up a webserver with live-server
- Linking html and javascript using "<script>"
- About the DOM (Document Object Model)
- Using querySelector, querySelectorAll
- Removing elements with remove
- Adding elements with createElement and appendChild

- Select dropdowns

## Section 8 - Data Storage, Libraries 

### What did I learn? 
- CRUD: Create Read Update Delete
- The local storage object
- .setItem(), .getItem() for applying CRUD operations
- Refactoring code and best practices 
- the debugger statement
- window and setting up event listeners 'storage' for data persistance 
- Introduced the 'new' keyword
- JavaScript Date objects
- Using Moment.js library 

## Section 9 - Expanding Our Javascript Knowledge

### What did I learn? 

- Arrow functions and shorthand for single line returns
- Arguments and the this keyword only exist in normal functions
- Refactored ToDo app and Notes app to use arrow function syntax
- The conditional operator
- Truthy-Falsy values and how to take advantage of that for checks of if something exists or not. 
- Type-coercion
- typeof 123 (evalutates to 'number')
- using throw 'error description' and Error('error description')
- The Try Catch statement
- Enabling strict mode: Add 'use strict' to the top of the file

## Section 10 - Advanced Objects and Functions

### What did I learn? 

- The new keyword
- Constructor functions
- Convention -> Upper case for constructors or objects
- Arrow functions allows access to the 'this' of the parent function
- How prototypical inheritance works in JS 
- JS primitives: String, Number, Boolean, Null, undefined (these are not objects)
- Hangman challenge game
- Classes, constructor() syntax 
- Subclasses using the 'extends' keyword
- Accessing parent constructor using super()
- Getters and Setters 

## Section 11 - Asynchronous JavaScript

### What did I learn? 

- How to make requests to APIs using XMLHttpRequest()
- The callback pattern and how it helps us with asychronous requests
- Small example of fetching data from the api restcountries.eu
- Working with closures 
- Currying functions 
- Working with Promises
- Promise chaining
- IP address API practice
- Async keyword and await operator
	- async marked functions return promises
	- await operator lets you set variables = promises eg) data = await myAsychronousFunction()
