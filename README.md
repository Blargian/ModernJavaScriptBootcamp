# ModernJavaScriptBootcamp
Learn JavaScript by building real-world apps. Includes 3 real-world projects, 80 programming challenges, and ES6/ES7!

## Section 3 - Javascript Basics: Variables and Flow Control

### What did I learn? 

Everything here is pretty straightforward.

- How to assign variables with the let keyword.
- The String data type 
- The Number data type
- The Boolean data type & the 6 main comparison operators
	1. "==="
	2. "!=="
	3. "<"
	4. ">"
	5. "<="
	6. ">="
- If, Else, Else-if statements
- And, Or operators
- Variable Scope (lexical scoping)

## Section 4 - Javascript Functions

### What did I learn? 

Everything here is pretty straightforward.

- Defining functions
- Undefined and Null, Null meant to avoid ambiguities with undefined ("explicit clearing").
- Multiple arguments.
- Default Arguments. 
- Template Strings.
	- No difference between double and single quotes in JS.
	- Use the dollar sign and curly braces to inject JS into a template string ` ... `
- Made a simple grade calculator.

## Section 5 - Javascript Objects

### What did I learn? 

- How to define objects and use functions which return objects
- Simple expense tracking exercise 
- Methods on objects
- The This keyword
- The const
- The Var

### What did I learn? 

- How to define arrays
- Methods: push, pop, shift and unshift, splice
- forEach and callback functions
- For loops 
- IndexOf 
- findIndex()or find() for arrays of objects
- filter() to return a new array of objects which match some condition
- The sort() method
- Used new knowledge to add methods to the Expense Tracker, Notes and ToDo list apps

## Section 7 - Javascript in the Browser

### What did I learn? 

- Setting up a webserver with live-server
- Linking html and javascript using "<script>"
- About the DOM (Document Object Model)

## Section 9 - Expanding Our Javascript Knowledge

### What did I learn? 

- Arrow functions and shorthand for single line returns
- Arguments and the this keyword only exist in normal functions
- Refactored ToDo app and Notes app to use arrow function syntax
- The conditional operator
- Truthy-Falsy values and how to take advantage of that for checks of if something exists or not. 
- Type-coercion
- typeof 123 (evalutates to 'number')
- using throw 'error description' and Error('error description')
- The Try Catch statement
- Enabling strict mode: Add 'use strict' to the top of the file

## Section 10 - Advanced Objects and Functions

### What did I learn? 

- The new keyword
- Constructor functions
- Convention -> Upper case for constructors or objects
- Arrow functions allows access to the 'this' of the parent function
- How prototypical inheritance works in JS 
- JS primitives: String, Number, Boolean, Null, undefined (these are not objects)
- Hangman challenge game
- Classes, constructor() syntax 
- Subclasses using the 'extends' keyword
- Accessing parent constructor using super()
- Getters and Setters
